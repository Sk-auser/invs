            <h2>Magnetic Simulation</h2>
            <p>This model is built to simulate the attraction of magnetic forces around a magnet. It also shows the magnetic field around two magnets, by emulating the behaviour of iron filings. A magnetic field is the magnetic force that is around something magnetic. </p>
                A concept I wanted to represent is the Inverse-Square Law. It states that the intensity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the source. In this case, it suggests that the magnetic field's strength diminishes as the distance from the magnet increases. 
                My simulation aims to show how magnetic filings should react around the presence of a magnet, and the impact of a stationary magnet on that of a moving one. </p>
                <strong>How to use it?</strong>
               <p1>
                The model is interactive:</p1>
                <ul>
                <li>Move the magnet on the left by dragging it</li>
                <li>Change the number of filings by entering a value </li>
                <li>Change the strength of the magnets by using the slider</li>
                <li>Use right and left arrow keys to rotate the moving magnet</li>
                <li>Refresh the page to reset the simulation</li> </ul>
